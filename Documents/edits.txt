x 1. The title of the app right now is "Doc scheduler Doc". Change it to "Real time Scheduler".

x 2. In "Signup" screen add a "Cancel" button. Right now I am forced to complete the process of profile creation.

x 3. After logging in, the screen looks a little cluttered and disorganized. I recommend the following structure:

User logged in: <full name>
<update>
Button <Post schedule update>

Today's Schedule
<place 1: time>
<place 2: time>
...

Button <See Weekly Schedule>

Button <Logout>         Button <Edit profile>

x 4. For "Edit profile" provide a "Cancel" button since I may not change anything.

x 5. For "Post update" screen, the tile is "Save update". Instead use "Schedule update".
Next line says "Save update for today". Instead say "Enter update for today".

x 6. In the main doctor screen, move the "Switch to patient" button further down to show it separate.

x 7. In Patient app, when a doctor is selected, 
- Mention update as "Today's update: <update>"
- Show today's schedule under the title "Today's schedule".
- Provide a button <Show weekly schedule> in which show the entire week's schedule in the format mentioned in an earlier email.
